What is fault tolerance

Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer, network, cloud cluster, etc.) to 
continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail.

The objective of creating a fault-tolerant system is to prevent disruptions arising from a single point of failure, 
ensuring the high availability and business continuity of mission-critical applications or systems.

Fault-tolerant systems use backup components that automatically take the place of failed components, ensuring no loss of service. 
These include:

Hardware systems:that are backed up by identical or equivalent systems. 
For example, a server can be made fault tolerant by using an identical server running in parallel, 
with all operations mirrored to the backup server.

Software systems that are backed up by other software instances. 
For example, a database with customer information can be continuously replicated to another machine. 
If the primary database goes down, operations can be automatically redirected to the second database.

Power sources that are made fault tolerant using alternative sources. 
For example, many organizations have power generators that can take over in case main line electricity fails.

HA is intended to handle problems while a system is running 
while DR is intended to handle problems after a system fails.


RTO(Recovery Time Objective)is the maximum time to restore critical functions following failure event.
RPO is the targeted amount of time during which data is at risk for loss in the event of a failure.


The difference between an incident and a problem:
Incident is any event that is not part of the standard operation of a service and that causes an interruption in service.
Problem is the unknown cause of one or more incidents.
