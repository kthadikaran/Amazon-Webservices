Route 53 Routing Policy

Scenarios:

Simple:
Simple routing policy route the traffic to the single resource.

Failover:
Failover routing allows you to route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy and 
to another resource when the first one is unhealthy. This is mainly used when you have the primary site and a disaster recovery site

Latency:
Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.

GeoProximity:
Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and optionally,shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in other location.

Geolocation:
Route traffic based on the location of users.
i. You can localize your website and present some or all of your website in the language of your users.
ii. You can restrict distribution of contents to only the location in which you have distribution rights.
iii. Useful for load balancing across endpoints in a predictable, easy to manage way, 
So that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint.

Latency based routing cannot guarantee users from the same geographic will be served from the same location for any compliance reason

Weighted:
Weighted routing policy can be applied when there are multiple resources that perform the same function for e.g., webservers serving the same site
Weighted resource record sets let you associate multiple resources with a single DNS name
