De monstration on AWS  Code Build
This  is areference  guidedocumented forDemonstration  on AWS  Code  Commit,  we  discussed above.

Prerequisites:
	1)IAM   user  account   with  AWSCodeBuildAdminAccess,  AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  and IAMFullAccess
	2)An S3 bucket to store build artifacts
	3)Integrated source code(source code + buildspec file) ofUI application to be stored in a CodeCommit repository. For this demo we have placed the source code in a repository named hellotelecom-UIrepo
	
Step 1:Navigate to CodeBuild screen from AWS management console

Step 2:Click on create build project

Step 3:Enter the project name <hellotelecom-UIbuild>

Step 4:Choose CodeCommitas   the   source   provider   and   then   choose   the   repository (hellotelecom-UIrepo) of the UI code

Step 5:Under Environment section choose the below values:
	-Environment image: Managed image
	-Operating system:  Ubuntu
	-Runtime: Node.js
	-Runtime version: aws/codebuild/nodejs.10.4.1

Step 6:Choose New service role and leave the Role name unchanged

Step 7:Choose Use abuildpsec fileoption

Step  8:Choose the location  for  output artifacts. 
	Let  it be Amazon  S3and  choose the bucketcreated for storing the build artifacts
	
Step 9:Choose the output artifacts packaging to be in Zip format

Step 10:Click Create build project

Step  11:Build Project  will be  successfully created  and  can  be  found  under  Build  projects  in CodeBuild screen

Step 12:To run the build, click on the project and then click on start build

Step 13:Verify the build configuration details and click on Start  build

Step 14:Build will be successful after a couple of minutes. To view the Output artifacts, click on View artifacts

Step 15:You will be redirected to S3 bucket. Click on Downloadto view the build artifacts

Step 16:Open the zip file and  verify the build artifacts
	2)Now on the similar lines perform build for application tier
	Before  performing  the  demonstration  kindly  place  the  integrated  source   code  (code  of application tier + buildspec file) in a CodeCommit repository.
