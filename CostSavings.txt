Advantage of AWS Savings Plans over AWS Reserved Instances

    With Reserved Instances, you're locking yourself into a certain instance type for 1 or 3 years but your 
    requirements may change in that time.
    
    Prices may change over your commitment period but you'll see no benefit of that 
    reduction with Reserved Instances
    
    Savings Plans allow you to take advantage of a discount without committing to use it on any specific 
    instance type (although flexibility varies between the Compute Plan and the EC2 Instance Plan)
    
    Savings Plans can be applied to Fargate as well as EC2 although it cannot be applied to RDS.
    
    The complexity of RIs has been eliminated with Savings Plans - there is far less planning around which type 
    of RI, which family and wether you'll want to later convert the RI or sell it on the marketplace.
    
    There's also less infrastructure planning - organizations no longer have to so deeply 
    plan complex infrastructure 1-3 years out, they can simply commit to using a certain amount of compute.
    With Savings Plans, the fundamentals allow you to flexibly transfer workloads between 
    instance types to meet demand and leverage something akin to elasticity, although you gain no advantage from down time. 
    With Reserved Instances, an organization sees no advantage from switching instance types or 
    families as they're committed to 24/7/365 usage of a specific instance type regardless.

Advantage of AWS Reserved Instances over Savings Plans

    You can get shorter term RIs on the marketplace
    You can get discounts for RDS as well as EC2 (but not Fargate).
    The discounts are larger and at the top end may be over 60% in the case of some 3 year all upfront terms.
